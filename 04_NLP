âœ¨ Features

Clean and preprocess SMS text

Convert text into features using Bag of Words or TF-IDF

Train a Naive Bayes model to classify messages

Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

ðŸ“Š Example Results

Accuracy: ~98%

Spam Detection: High precision and recall

âš¡ How to Use

Load the dataset (SMSSpamCollection).

Preprocess messages (clean text, remove stopwords, lemmatize).

Train the Naive Bayes model.

Test with new messages for prediction.
