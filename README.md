# AI_Projects_Journey
A collection of my Deep Learning and NLP practice codes, covering different models, architectures, and experiments.
# 🧠 AI Projects Practice

This repository contains my practice projects and experiments in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, focusing on **Deep Learning** and **Neural Networks**.  
Each folder represents a separate project implemented during my learning journey.

## 📂 Projects Included

| Project Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| [ANN_Implementation] (01_ANN_Practical_Implementation.ipynb)  | Implementation of a basic Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using Python and TensorFlow/Keras |
| [CNN_CIFAR10](./CNN_CIFAR10.ipynb) . | Image classification on CIFAR-10 dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) |

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Understand and implement different neural network architectures  
- Practice model training, evaluation, and optimization  
- Work with real-world datasets for computer vision and NLP tasks  

## 🔮 Future Plans
I’ll keep adding more projects here, including:
- RNN and LSTM for text data  
- NLP-based models (sentiment analysis, embeddings, etc.)  
- Transfer learning experiments (VGG, ResNet, etc.)
