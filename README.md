# 🧠 AI Projects Practice

This repository contains my practice projects and experiments in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, focusing on **Deep Learning** and **Neural Networks**.  
Each folder represents a separate project implemented during my learning journey.

## 📂 Projects Included

| Project Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| [ANN_Implementation](./01_ANN_Practical_Implementation.ipynb)  | Implementation of a basic Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using Python and TensorFlow/Keras |
| [CNN_CIFAR10](./02_CNN_CIFAR10_Dataset.ipynb) . | Image classification on CIFAR-10 dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) |
| [Natural Language Processing (NLP)-1](./03_NLP.ipynb) |  Project focused on text processing tasks including tokenization, stopwords removal, lemmatization , BOW & TF-IDF. Detailed steps and explanations available in the folder.
| [NLP-2 -> Word2vec & Avgword2vec](./04_NLP_Word2Vec_&_AvgWord2Vec.ipynb) | Word Embedding Techniques using Word2Vec & Average Word2Vec | Transforming text into meaningful numeric vectors for smarter NLP understanding.
| [NLP-3 -> Word_Embedding_Techniques](./05_Word_Embedding_Techniques.ipynb)|Implementation of various Word Embedding techniques using Keras — from One-Hot Encoding to dense vector representations.
| [NLP-4 -> Bidirectional_LSTM](./06_LSTM_Practical_Implementation.ipynb)| Fake News Detection using Bidirectional LSTM | Achieved 86% accuracy by capturing forward & backward context from text for smarter classification.
