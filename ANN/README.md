## ⚙️ Steps Performed

1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing**
- Imported dataset  
- Normalized and split into training and testing sets  

2️⃣ **Model Building**
- Sequential model using Keras  
- Dense hidden layers with ReLU activation  
- Output layer with Sigmoid / Softmax (depending on the dataset type)  

3️⃣ **Model Compilation**
- Optimizer: `adam`  
- Loss: `binary_crossentropy` / `categorical_crossentropy`  
- Metrics: `accuracy`

4️⃣ **Model Training**
- Fit the model on training data  
- Validate using test data  
- Plotted loss and accuracy curves  

5️⃣ **Model Evaluation**
- Calculated accuracy, precision, recall  
- Visualized predictions (if applicable)
